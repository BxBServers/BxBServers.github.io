  <p>In the two years BxBServers has been up, we have all learned so much. It's been an honor having this wonderful community who has stuck with us through thick and thin. We would not have made it as far as we did without you guys, it has truely been a blessing on us all.
  <br/> Size was never BxBServers strong point, but where we lacked in size we gained in community. Our goal has always been to provide the best for our players, as they were most important. We can only hope that we provided that. All of you will have a place our hearts as you were all important to us, and to the community. For that, we thank you. It has been amazing seeing the friendships that came from our servers. I, (Euthorix) personally have met some really great friends out of this who I hope to keep around for as long as possible, and I hope that many of you can say the same. </p>
