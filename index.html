   <div class="container">
  <p>In the two years BxBServers has been up, we have all learned so much. It's been an honor having this wonderful community who has stuck with us through thick and thin. We would not have made it as far as we did without you guys, it has truely been a blessing on us all.
  <br/><br/> Size was never BxBServers strong point, but where we lacked in size we gained in community. Our goal has always been to provide the best for our players, as they were most important. We can only hope that we provided that. All of you will have a place our hearts as you were all important to us, and to the community. For that, we thank you. It has been amazing seeing the friendships that came from our servers. I, (Euthorix) personally have met some really great friends out of this who I hope to keep around for as long as possible, and I hope that many of you can say the same. </p>
<br/><br/> To all of our previous staff members, thank you for working so hard to keep our servers alive and well, I would name all of you, but we do not have the room for it. Each of you played a very imporant role in this community, and I hope that is something that you can be proud of, as we are proud of all of you. Thank you for your service, and we wish you the best in your future endeavors.

And to every single donator. Thank you! You guys were the backbone of the community, without your generous help, whether it be a $2 donation or a $100 donation; you have all helped tremendously. I would list all of our amazing donators, but again, there is not enough room for it. I can only hope that you do not regret donating now that we're gone. A special thanks to all of you
  
  <br/><br/>
   And last, but certainly not least; The rest of the community. Some of you have only been with us for a short while, while some of you have been with us for nearly two years, all of you played a big role in the building of this community. You were the ones who defined it. You were the ones that made our servers what they were - a great place for people to come on and feel like they're part of a big family. I expect you all will find new homes and make them as great as you made this one. Thank you all.

Thank you, and farewell.</br>
BxB Team</br></br></br>

P.s While we won't be having any more servers, we can all still keep in touch with our teamspeak which we have no plans of shutting down. (104.131.132.172:9987)
